LISA BLUDER: Nowhere, nowhere in the country could this happen except for at the University of Iowa.

KELLY: Something else that only happens at the University of Iowa? The Hawkeye wave. That is when everyone - the athletes, coaches, staff and the thousands of fans in the stands - wave to the young patients and their families watching the action through the windows of the children's hospital next to the field.

CHANG: And this time, that wave of hope and support came with a significant bonus for the hospital - a cheque for a quarter-million dollars from the game's proceeds.
