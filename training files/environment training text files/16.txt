Every five years, the U.S. releases the National Climate Assessment, a comprehensive analysis of how climate change is affecting the country. The fifth assessment was recently released. It's the first to include standalone chapters about climate change's toll on the U.S. economy, as well as the complex social factors driving climate change and the nation's responses.

Climate reporters Rebecca Hersher and Alejandra Borunda have read the report and talk about three key takeaways: the economics, the negative human health effects and the unequal burden people face. Plus, a silver lining: All the ways the U.S. is making progress to slow the effects of climate change.
