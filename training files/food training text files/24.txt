Fall is in full swing, and one New Englander wants to make sure you get your seasonally appropriate treats in the most efficient way possible.

What is it? The New England Cider Donut Map is exactly what it sounds like, a resource to help you get access to the fall confection.

It was created by self-proclaimed "cider donuteur" Alex Schwartz, who started the project in 2020, categorizing the more than 350 options between a fresh and warm option, or a pre-baked store variety.

Schwartz spoke to Sacha Pfeiffer on All Things Considered about where their inspiration for the project came from, and why they love the sweet treats so dearly.

A great apple cider donut â€” you're going to look at what's the fry level. What's the density of the crumb of the donut? Does the apple taste in the batter actually come through? But I think the most important element is actually the environment and the way that you're receiving it, right? Like, if they make them hot and fresh directly in front of you at the orchard. That's a very different experience from buying them at a Shaw's when they're cold in a plastic box.
