At Wednesday's game between San Antonio's Spurs and LA's Clippers, Popovich explained you don't poke the bear. Leonard, an ex-Spurs player, scored 18 of his game high 26 points after the announcement.

A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

Good morning, I'm A Martínez. During last night's Spurs/Clippers game, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich decided to address the home crowd.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GREGG POPOVICH: Can we stop all the booing and let these guys play? It's got no class. That's not who we are.

MARTÍNEZ: Seemed like he was defending his former player, Clippers star Kawhi Leonard. But as Popovich later explained, anyone that knows anything about sports knows you don't poke the bear. Leonard scored 18 of his game high 26 points after the announcement, and his team won. So too little, too late, Pop. It's MORNING EDITION.
