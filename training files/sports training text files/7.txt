A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

Good morning. I'm A Martínez. Seattle Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf has figured out a new way to trash talk without getting into trouble - at least so far. After scoring a touchdown against the Los Angeles Rams last Sunday, Metcalf proceeded to use American Sign Language to troll Rams cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon. Metcalf has said that he started taking ASL classes so he can avoid getting flagged by referees. His Seahawks play the 49ers today, where he might be signing off. It's MORNING EDITION.
